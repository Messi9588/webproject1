        <h2>Why Conservation Matters</h2>
        <p>The environment protection is not just a hedonistic duty, rather, it is a heroich mission of the preservation of abundance and the diversity of nature.
            The nature is the one that if without must be breathing we, the water to drink and the food to eatâ€”it is the one that is sustaining us. The decisions we make now will be important to shaping the kind of tomorrow we want.
            we are sculpting our world and that of the future today. It links up with basically everything, the situation of the environment as well as the well-being of many species, including human beings.
            two-thirds of the 21st century is available and the final settlement regarding the time of all future generations is near at hand. The initial duty is to teach pupils about the idea that all worldwide biomes are highly interrelated.
            they directly communicated with nature one and so they learned how to live together with nature which takes care of us..</p>
        
        <h2>Our Goals</h2>
        <p>We strive to bring awareness, encourage actions, and influence policies that are friendly to nature. Partake in our efforts to trigger the change.
            strives to sustain the health of our planet. Promotion of the sensible use of water through dissemination of information, lobbying for the stronger water policies and reinforcement the arrangements.
            if we each take actions to ensure our actions are right and make ourselves into change-makers, we can start a movement where the health of the planet comes first, not short-term gains.We
            imagine about a Earth where humands are in balance or solidarity with nature and as a result we may achieve thriving and green Earth.</p>
